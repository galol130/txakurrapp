*March 2021.*

TxakurrApp is the platform for finding and sharing pet services.

Whether you are a pet owner looking for a service, or a person willing to offer pet services, you can get in contact with your counterpart easily.

*Important!* Since the deploy was done using a free account, it takes a few seconds to start the microservices. Be patient! :)

## ‚öôÔ∏èFunctionalities
Browsing the services can be done without logging in. You can't save to favorites nor send messages.

1. **Registration process**

    When signing up, you'll only be asked for an email, password and if registering as a Pet Owner or a Service Provider.
   If successful, you'll be asked to log in with your credentials.
   To finish the registration process, you must fill the form with your information.
   

2. **Once logged in**

    After finishing the registration process, you can access your account data, organized in 3 tabs:
   - My Profile: All the personal information.
    - My Pets/My Services: From this tab you can manage your pets (pet owner) and your services (service provider).
    - My Favs: All the services you have added as favorites.
    
3. **Messages**

    From here you can keep track of all your conversations with your counterpart.

*Extra* If trying to access an incorrect URL, you'll get to a page with a collaboration with Missing Children Europe.
