## ✔️ Technologies and Stack
The back-end was developed using microservices in Java Spring Boot.
The deployment was done in Heroku using 'free dynos'. This is why the app may have high latency when the server is set to sleep mode.
The front-end was developed using Angular 10 with Material and Bootstrap libraries.
The deployment was done in Firebase.
